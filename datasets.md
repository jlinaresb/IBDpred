# Datasets

This work used three different datasets. One for training the models and two to validate the prediction models.

## Dataset for training
We used American Gut Project (AGP) to train the model. Dataset was downloaded from [AGP repository](ftp://ftp.microbio.me/AmericanGut/).

## Datasets for validation
Two independent and external cohorts were used to validate our models.

1. ChronÂ´s subset from [Gervers et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24629344/)
2. Ulcerative colitis from [Morgan et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23013615/)

Both datasets were retrieved from [MLRepo](https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/) repository created by KnightsLab. After clone [MLRepo](https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/), you must to copy ````gevers```` and ```morgan``` folders into ```extdata``` folder.
